# Deployment Status

## ✅ Completed

1. ✅ Got all Vercel credentials
2. ✅ Linked project to Vercel
3. ✅ Added GitHub secrets for deployment
4. ✅ Pushed all code to GitHub (except workflow file)
5. ✅ Created database schema
6. ✅ Created all documentation

## ⚠️ One More Step Needed

**Add the GitHub Actions workflow file manually**

The workflow file exists locally but needs to be added through GitHub's web interface due to API restrictions.

### Quick Instructions:

1. Go to: https://github.com/commandapps/bipolarpeople/new/main
2. In the filename box, type: `.github/workflows/vercel-deploy.yml`
3. Copy the content from `ADD-WORKFLOW-MANUALLY.md` or this file below:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel (main)

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      deployments: write
    env:
      VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
      VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Pull Vercel environment
        run: npx vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN"

      - name: Build (prebuilt)
        run: npx vercel build --prod --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN"

      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: npx vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token "$VERCEL_TOKEN"
```

4. Paste it, commit, and you're done!

See `ADD-WORKFLOW-MANUALLY.md` for detailed instructions.

## After Adding the Workflow

Once the workflow file is added to GitHub, it will automatically:
- Trigger on every push to main
- Build your Next.js app
- Deploy to Vercel

Watch it at: https://github.com/commandapps/bipolarpeople/actions

## Next Steps

After deployment works, you still need to:

1. **Set up environment variables in Vercel** (see NEXT-STEPS.md)
2. **Create and configure your database** (see DEPLOYMENT.md)
3. **Test your app** at your Vercel URL

## Your Credentials (for reference)

- VERCEL_TOKEN: `qmHqsiAfBfVux0eSFYJjNSaG`
- VERCEL_ORG_ID: `team_aECiG1V5L4rZ7AHusvX3T25W`
- VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: `prj_93ACkIrD17Dg1Dpq9sgmP8XwbHjx`

All three are already added to your GitHub repository secrets.
