## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets (2 minutes)

**Go to:** `https://github.com/yourusername/bipolarpeople/settings/secrets/actions`

Add these three secrets (see `GITHUB-SECRETS.md` for exact values):

1. `VERCEL_TOKEN` â†’ `qmHqsiAfBfVux0eSFYJjNSaG`
2. `VERCEL_ORG_ID` â†’ `team_aECiG1V5L4rZ7AHusvX3T25W`
3. `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` â†’ `prj_93ACkIrD17Dg1Dpq9sgmP8XwbHjx`

Click "New repository secret" for each one, paste the value, and save.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables in Vercel (5 minutes)

Go to your Vercel project: https://vercel.com/your-username/bipolarpeople/settings/environment-variables

Add these **required** environment variables:

#### Auth
- `AUTH_SECRET` - Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- `AUTH_URL` - Your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://bipolarpeople.vercel.app`)

#### Email (Resend)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Get from: https://resend.com/api-keys
- `EMAIL_FROM` - Your verified domain (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`)

#### Database (If you create one)
- `DATABASE_URL` - Will be auto-provided by Vercel Postgres

### Step 3: Set Up Your Database (10 minutes)

**Option A: Create Vercel Postgres**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Storage
2. Click "Create Database" â†’ Postgres
3. Once created, click "Query" tab
4. Paste the contents of `schema.sql`
5. Click "Run" to create all tables

**Option B: Use Existing Database**
```bash
psql $YOUR_DATABASE_URL < schema.sql
```

Then verify:
```bash
npm run db:check
```

### Step 4: Deploy! ðŸš€

Once you've added the secrets, you can deploy:

```bash
# Push to GitHub (triggers automatic deployment)
git add .
git commit -m "Add deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

Or trigger manually in GitHub Actions:
1. Go to: https://github.com/yourusername/bipolarpeople/actions
2. Click "Deploy to Vercel (main)"
3. Click "Run workflow"
