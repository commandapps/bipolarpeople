## üí° Tips for Using This Documentation

1. **Start Small:** Don't try to implement everything at once. Focus on one guide at a time.
2. **Check Dependencies:** Some features depend on others (e.g., tools need database setup first).
3. **Iterate:** The code review document provides priorities - implement in that order.
4. **Test As You Go:** Don't skip the testing sections in each guide.
5. **Ask Questions:** Each document includes questions to help you get specific help.
