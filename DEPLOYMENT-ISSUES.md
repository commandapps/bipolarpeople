## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issue

### NextAuth v5 Beta Compatibility

Your project uses NextAuth v5 beta which has breaking changes from v4.

**Problem:** 
- The `auth()` function pattern from NextAuth v5 doesn't work the same way in API routes
- Current workaround returns empty session object
- This means authentication checks in API routes won't work properly

**Location:** `src/lib/auth.ts` line 74-81

```typescript
export async function getServerSession() {
  // TODO: Fix this - NextAuth v5 beta has breaking changes
  // This is a temporary workaround
  return {} as any
}
```

**Impact:**
- API routes will accept all requests as authenticated
- No actual authentication checking happening
- Production app is vulnerable

## üîß Solutions

You have two options:

### Option 1: Downgrade to NextAuth v4 (Recommended for Production)

```bash
npm install next-auth@latest
```

Then update all imports back to the working pattern.

### Option 2: Fix NextAuth v5 Implementation

Research the correct NextAuth v5 pattern for server-side auth in API routes and implement properly.

### Option 3: Disable API Route Auth Temporarily

Keep current workaround for now, but add proper auth middleware or JWT verification in production.

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Decide on authentication approach** (v4 vs v5)
2. **Fix or replace the session checking**
3. **Test authentication flows**
4. **Deploy with working auth**

## üö® Security Note

**DO NOT deploy to production** with the current auth workaround. Your API routes are currently open to anyone.
